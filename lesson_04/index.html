					<h3>Name</h3>
					<p>The city is known under two names, which differ in Ukrainian and Russian; there are several transliterations of each name. <span class="main-word">Mykolaiv</span> was founded by Prince Grigory Potemkin as Nikolaev, it was the last of the many cities he established. On 27 August 1789, Potemkin ordered its naming near the wharf at the mouth of the Ingul river, on a high, cool and breezy spot where the Ingul river meets the Southern Bug river. To build the city he brought in peasants, soldiers, and Turkish prisoners; 2,500 were working there during 1789. The shipyards were built first (1788).</p>
